        <p>In Europe «juggling convention» is a well-known word collocation and it doesn`t cause
        misunderstandings. Juggling in Europe has been developed a long time ago and now it`s
        nothing special. But the situation in Russia is different. In our juggling culture we
        have a big gap between «professional circus jugglers» and «non-professional jugglers».
        But fortunately year by year the level of our creative guys increases and juggling
        hatherings happen more often.</p>
        <p>The only way we can name it is «convention» which means «gathering». It`s not a festival,
        it`s not a meating, it`s not a holiday — it includes all those and something more.
        Choosing the word «convention» we choose the atmosphere of european juggling conventions —
        the atmosphere of happiness, freedom and creativity.</p>

        <p>Because we breathe and live by this art, we believe in beauty and strength of this genre
        and we want to give everyone a chance to touch this magic. We want this convention to
        become a powerful wave for everyone, and we want everyone finding themselves in this wave,
        from the very beginners who first ever handeled balls to the very professionals. It`s
        not just our wish — we have already done it and we continue to do it.</p>

        <p>Here every spectator turns into a participant. There are a lot of workshops matching
        everyone`s taste, many juggling games and an exciting parade! In a flash you are not just
        a viewer any more — you now make the magic of juggling by yourself! Furthermore, every
        evening you can have a rest and watch the great masters. Who knows, may be tomorrow
        you`ll be one of them!</p>
        <p>We prepare many surprises for you.</p>

      <p>There is a wonderful slogan in Europe: «Jugglers for the jugglers». We made this convention
      ourselves. We do what we believe in, and you are welcome to join us. First of all it`s a
      good way to feel yourself implicated, to become a part of the whole concept. What is more,
      it`s a new experience, new friends and it`s the shortest way to be in the thick of things!</p>
